## Instructions

For this project, you will be applying machine learning techniques that go beyond standard linear regression. You will have the opportunity to use a publicly available dataset to solve the problem of your choice. You are strongly discouraged from using well-known datasets, particularly ones that have been used as examples in previous courses or are similar to them (such as the iris, titanic, mnist, or movielens datasets, among others) - this is your opportunity to branch out and explore some new data! The UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle are good places to seek out a dataset. Kaggle also maintains a curated list of datasets that are cleaned and ready for machine learning analyses. Your dataset must be automatically downloaded in your code or included with your submission. You may not submit the same project for both the MovieLens and Choose Your Own project submissions, and your Choose Your Own project submission may not simply be a variation of your MovieLens project.

The ability to clearly communicate the process and insights gained from an analysis is an important skill for data scientists. You will submit a report that documents your analysis and presents your findings, with supporting statistics and figures. The report must be written in English and uploaded as both a PDF document and an Rmd file. Although the exact format is up to you, the report should include the following at a minimum:

- an introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and variables, and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed;
- a methods/analysis section that explains the process and techniques used, including data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, insights gained, and your modeling approaches (you must use at least two different models or algorithms);
- a results section that presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance; and
- a conclusion section that gives a brief summary of the report, its potential impact, its limitations, and future work.

Your project submission will be graded both by your peers and by a staff member. The peer grading will give you an opportunity to check out the projects done by other learners. You are encouraged to give your peers thoughtful, specific feedback on their projects (i.e., more than just "good job" or "not enough detail").

# Data

Category 1: no exoplanet
Category 2: exoplanet

# Data Exploration and Visualization

## Variations with Time

There are examples of category 1 (no exoplanet) stars with cyclic luminosity:
43 or 47

Examples of category 2 (exoplanet) which have clear cycles:

## Example

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
